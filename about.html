			<h1> MAJA NYBERG </h1>
			<h2>UX DESIGNER | INTERACTION DESIGN STUDENT</h2>
			<p>My name is Maja Nyberg, I’m a 26-year-old software engineering
        student originating from Gothenburg. I’m currently studying for
        a master’s degree in Interaction Design and Technologies at
        Chalmers University of Technology.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m an ambitious and hard-working, soon-to-be Software engineer,
        with a great passion for UX and UI design. My dream is to become
        a UX designer who by her work makes a difference to some one,
        in some way.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have a wide range of interests including UX and graphical design,
         photography, travel and coffee. My first job after graduating
         secondary high school was as a barista, which has left its marks!
         <br>
         <br>

         of my projects an illustrations by using the top menu.
