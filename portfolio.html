			<h2>BACHELOR THESIS</h2>
			<p>As our bachelor thesis we implemented an iOS application created
        for children at the museum Universeum in Gothenburg.
        The application enabled the children to experience the museum
        through collaborative photography missions.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the design leader in the group, my main responsibilities were
        to develop several prototypes, which after testing and evaluation
        resulted in the final design which was implemented. This included
        doing user experience research, listing requirements and
        finalizing a user interface including illustrations with Adobe
        Illustrator.

			<h1 > Room booking system </h1>
			<h2>COURSE - GRAPHICAL INTERFACES</h2>
			<p>
        Our first individual school project where we were to design a room
        booking system for a university. I interviewed teachers and students
        to know what they usually do in a room booking system, and what they
        believe that the current systems are lacking. I set up a few
        requirements as a foundation for the functionality, and thereafter
        created my designs by using Figma.

      <h2>COURSE - DESIGNING USER EXPERIENCES</h2>
      <p>As a design project for school we were to design something
        that would evoke a distinct emotion. I used critical design to
        create a website with the purpose to evoke discussion regarding
        euthanasia and a personâ€™s right to die. This is the project that has
				meant the most to me on a personal level because it made me think,
				and reflect on life.

			<h2>COURSE - DESIGNING USER EXPERIENCES</h2>
			<p>
				As a school project we were to explore spatial and temporal
				aspects of design in order to create an experience. We created
				GO:Explore which is a mobile application trackings people
				everyday movement with the purpose to encourage a more active
				and environmentally friendly lifestyle. When people are walking
				or biking to work in real life, they are walking towards a
				preset goal in the application - perhaps Paris? The users get
				notifications when passing famous monuments and buildings.

      <p>At the #metoo-hack in Gothenburg, 2018, we created a tool
				with tips and suggestions of what to do or say in situations
				where sexual harrasment can occur. The tool was an Android
